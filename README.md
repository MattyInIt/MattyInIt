# 👋 Hey, I'm unfamilliar

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a self-taught developer from Czechoslovakia 🇨🇿🇸🇰 who enjoys creating, tweaking, and experimenting with software. I love working on personal projects, learning new things, and diving into the technical details of how things work.

Whether it's working with game servers, automating stuff with code, or exploring the Linux ecosystem — I'm always building or breaking something.

## 🛠️ What I Work On

- 🎮 **Minecraft Servers** – Gamemodes like BedWars, SkyWars, KBFFA, and backend configs  
- 🐧 **Linux Tweaking** – Customizing and learning various distros for daily use  
- 💬 **Online Communities** – Moderating and running forums, mostly tech or gaming-related  
- 🧪 **Personal Experiments** – Scripts, mods, configs, and random little projects for fun
